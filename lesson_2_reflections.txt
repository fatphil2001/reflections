What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new git repository in that folder.
It creates the metadata required to track file changes in that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area lets you declare what's going to be checked-in by source control.  It means you can group related items in to a logical commit.
